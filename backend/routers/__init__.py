# routers/__init__.py - Router Package Initialisation
# =============================================================================
# This file makes the 'routers' directory a Python package, allowing us to
# import routers like: from routers import settings, subjects, lessons
#
# We could also expose the routers here for cleaner imports, but keeping
# them separate in main.py makes dependencies more explicit.
